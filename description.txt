[c/ff7857:== We're back! New update, v0.3! ==]

✧ Terramon is a mod that adds Pokémon to Terraria! It also adds many aspects and mechanics of the Pokémon games as well, including Pokémon themselves, Poké Balls, your very own Pokémon party and much more. Terramon is constantly being improved to match the Pokémon games as much as possible, so remember to update often for new features weekly.

✧ The mod is designed to be as immersive as possible, with non-linear game play and different objectives/quests to complete.

✧ Currently in the mod, there's...
• More than 30 Pokémon!
• New UI and mechanics!
• 43 new items
• 31 buffs
