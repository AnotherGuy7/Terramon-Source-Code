Terramon is a cross between Terraria and the awesome Pokémon franchise. The mod adds many new Pokémon and your mission is to catch 'em all!
Have fun with...
-Throwable Pokéballs that can be used to catch 'mons or hurt enemies.
-A Pokémon Trainer Town NPC that can move in as soon as you start the game! He will sell you Pokéballs and evolve your Pokémon.
-20+ different Pokémon to discover and catch!
-An interactive Pokédex that can be used to call Professor Oak!

We're aiming to make this mod a smashing success with Pokémon fans all over the Terraria community. Give the mod a try and tell us what you think of it over at our Discord Server (homepage)!
