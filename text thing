we can still coordinate programming and stuff to do with the mod here?

of course -jamz

do we have a more conventional way to do this, or are we sticking with the text file? -HU

Don't do battling without me, I know how its going to look. Thanks.
Anything notable going on with the mod/server right now?
Also, any ideas for a better place to chat??

Could you show an example of its look? I'm interested. 
In the server, Nick is planning some sort of valentine's event, and Noved has moved up to trial mod.
Also didn't you make an experimental chat room yourself? Besides that, I can't think of any other method.

Uh, can't really show you visually right now and it would be really complicated to explain in words (the battling concept).
A valentines event sounds interesting, also, glad that Noved has moved up to Trial Mod, hopefully even Mod in the near future.
That chat room was pretty impractical with the lack of notifications and stuff, but I'll reply to any messages sent there within like a few hours or so if you send any
