We need a way to talk, that isn't Discord, but works in a practical way. ASAP

yeah. Problem is, if you can't use social medias, that knocks out a ton of good, accessible ways to communicate.
I've looked around, but most things I can find don't really fit our needs (mainly voice talk, is paid, etc.)
I suppose it'd be easier to find something if we looked at this with a business perspective, rather than of a Terraria mod,
but I can never seem to word Google searches correctly to find the results I require.

if you're available now, perhaps we should use minnit to brainstorm. Not long-term, but it'll do for quick conversations.

You're there?
